# Application Description

This is a lightweight single-page web application built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which follows a client-side rendering (CSR) approach.

The application incorporates Bootstrap for responsive styling and includes custom CSS styles. JavaScript code manipulates the DOM to handle user interactions and update the page content.

To use the application, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. It does not rely on external frameworks or libraries, making it easy to deploy and customize.

Contributions and feedback are welcome via pull requests or issues on the GitHub repository.
